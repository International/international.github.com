Fix for the error:

In file included from binder.cpp:20:
./project.h:107:10: fatal error: 'openssl/ssl.h' file not found

<!-- exce -->

Found the answer [here](https://github.com/state-machines/state_machines/issues/33)

{% highlight bash %}
brew install openssh
bundle config build.eventmachine --with-cppflags=-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include
{% endhighlight %}
