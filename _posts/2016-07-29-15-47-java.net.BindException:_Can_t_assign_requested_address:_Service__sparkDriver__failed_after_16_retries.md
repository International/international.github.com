Received this error:
<pre>
java.net.BindException: Can't assign requested address: Service 'sparkDriver' failed after 16 retries
</pre>

Luckily, I found [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34601554/mac-spark-shell-error-initializing-sparkcontext) stackoverflow post, listing instructions:

* run `hostname`
* check if the output is present in `/etc/hosts`
* assuming hostname returned potato, you should have in `/etc/hosts` a line like this:
<pre>
127.0.0.1 potato
</pre>
* run the java code again, and it should pass
