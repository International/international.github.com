Been receiving this message when trying to install esl-erlang:

{% highlight bash %}
Depends: libssl0.9.8 but it is not installable
{% endhighlight %}

So, I went to [Erlang Solutions Page](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html),
and I downloaded the deb for my platform (64bit), and installed it. Afterwards, I
followed the steps shown on elixir's page:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir.git
$ cd elixir
$ make clean test
{% endhighlight %}

Followed by a `sudo make install`, and I got elixir running on my pc.
