[EM-Proxy] (https://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy) is awesome. Check the repo for
examples of what it can do. I've also played a bit with it, and I made a very 
basic proxy that won't forward requests if the User-Agent is curl. Sample code,
basic as it is, can be found [here] (https://github.com/International/rev_proxy) .
